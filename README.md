### what was new for me:
### grep command was new for me and especially | sign;
### what surprised me:
### ~ symbol was a surprise for me, as I saw it many times but did not know its meaning;
### what i intend to use in future:
### some commands that i used before as 'copy-paste', i will use meaningfully from now on.
